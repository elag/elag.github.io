      <h1>Conference subthemes 2014</h1>
      <h2> ELAG 2014 &ndash; Lingering gold: Sub-themes</h2>
	  <h3> Data management of local repositories and research data</h3>
      <p>Academic and research libraries are starting to manage local output by developing repositories of local publications.  Increasingly, they are getting involved with research data management. Some are busy organising metadata about researchers. Others are installing data labs or library labs, so that library people and researchers can get together before items are published to produce metadata for research data and publications.</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2014 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Supporting the full research life cycle and infrastructure</li>
        <li> Data storage, preservation, reuse</li>
        <li> Big data</li>
        <li> Research data labs in initial stages of research projects</li>
        <li> Exchange of (meta)data between systems and services</li>
        <li> Publishing research project information in the broadest sense, not only publications and datasets, but project plans, funding, related people and organisations, methods, software etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> LAM (Libraries, Archives, Museums)</h3>
	    <p>Libraries could do more to encourage cross-collaboration with other domains and identify the types of data that could be relevant to those domains. Once identified, they should promote them (through focused collaboration) or develop ways of making them available.</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2014 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Shared automation services</li>
        <li> Publication of data as Linked Data, via APIs</li>
        <li> Collaborative LAM initiatives and the lessons learned</li>
      </ul>
		<h3> Library User Support and Training</h3>
		<p> Digital collections are being used in new ways by researchers, students and public library patrons. Data is being delivered online to the users' preferred environments, whenever they need it and as often as they need it.
			Library services face new questions regarding support for these processes, be it Information Literacy support for researchers; copyright issues; technical support for VRE's and VLE's; research data management training; app-development and maintenance, game development and integration, etc.
		</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2014 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> supporting this change in information consumption</li>
        <li> development of new services</li>
        <li> getting involved in the learning process</li>
      </ul>
	    <h3> Special digital collections</h3>
	    <p> National libraries are opening digital newspaper collections. Other libraries have produced digital collections of maps, old books, pictures, etc. Some academic libraries are trying to complete the bibliography of their own research output by digitizing all theses and locally produced research reports. They come up with new interfaces to use these collections.</p>
	    <p> At ELAG 2014 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li> new services on digital collections</li>
	     </ul>
	  <h3> Beyond bibliographic data</h3>
	  <p> Much effort goes into the production and curation of bibliographic data. But libraries have far more data: holdings, transactions, users, statistics, full texts/linked resources.</p>
	  <p> At ELAG 2014 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> catalogue enrichment (articles, web pages, e-books), images, sound,... What can we do with that data?</li>
	    <li> data analysis</li>
      <li> data enrichment</li>
	    <li> data visualisation</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h3> Automation</h3>
	  <p> Some libraries have robots that pick up books from the shelves or scan books at high speed. What's out there and what more can we think off. Are there clever robots that can classify books with terms from a controlled vocabulary, by scanning a book at 250 pages a minute ?</p>
	  <p> At ELAG 2014 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> automation of library workflows</li>
	    <li> using robots in libraries</li>
	    <li> building hyper local services, using tools that are globally available</li>
	     </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Perhaps you have another library technology topic that you would love to tell us about, but it doesn&rsquo;t fall neatly into one of the sub-themes. Don&rsquo;t be shy; tell us anyway! </p>
