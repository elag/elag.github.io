      <h1>Conference subthemes 2013</h1>
      <h2> ELAG 2013 &ndash; The INSIDE-OUT Library: Sub-themes</h2>
      <h3> Data management</h3>
      <p> Especially academic and research libraries are starting to manage local output. It started off managing local repositories of publications. Now they are getting involved in data repositories. Some are busy organising metadata about researchers. Others are installing data labs or library labs, so that library people and researchers can get together before things are published to produce metadata for research data and publications.</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2013 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Supporting the full research life cycle and infrastructure</li>
        <li> Data storage, preservation, reuse</li>
        <li> Big data</li>
        <li> Research data labs in initial stages of research projects</li>
        <li>          Coordination of (meta)data between systems and services</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Publishing</h3>
      <p> Libraries are actively trying to publish output in open access. They are assisting local staff in the publication process. Some start publishing activities.</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2013 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Support in research publication processes</li>
        <li> Libraries as (open access) scholarly publishers</li>
        <li> New forms of publishing (enhanced) content</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> New ways of accessing information</h3>
      <p> Users are not starting their quest for information from your library catalogue. They are probably not even starting from your 'new' global discovery system. If this is the case, how can you make sure they are still supported by the library.</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2013 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Other channels to libraries' content</li>
        <li> Creating virtual subject gateways</li>
        <li> Library services configured around experiences rather than collections</li>
        <li> Embedding libraries content in other services</li>
        <li> Libraries and search engines indexation</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Local focus</h3>
      <p> Modern technologies can tell us more and more about the way local users use our data. Libraries can make intelligent use of this knowledge to support new or better services. Libraries have always had local and unique collections. How can we expose these unique collections to the world in a meaningful way ?</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2013 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> New uses of local holdings and usage information</li>
        <li> New organisation and visualisation of collections</li>
        <li> Unique collections</li>
        <li> Local expertise, projects</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> LAM (Libraries, Archives, Museums)</h3>
      <p> Libraries, Archives and Museums start to collaborate by using similar and complementary technologies, to try to find common solutions to shared problems. Libraries provide in this context content, data and expertise that can be embedded in other domains' workflow and services. What can we learn from each other? How can we make sure this cooperation not only yields cost savings but will also lead to better services?</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2013 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Shared automation services</li>
        <li> Publication of data as Linked Data, via APIs</li>
        <li> LAM initiatives and the lessons learned</li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Teaching</h3>
      <p> Consider that the current academic library no longer requires students and faculty to come to the libraries for their information seeking and consumption. It delivers material online to the users' preferred environment, when they need the information, in ways that support time-shifting consumption and repeated encounters. Library services are being re-invented around support for the processes of learning and research rather than collections.</p>
      <p> At ELAG 2013 we would like you to talk about things like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> supporting this change in information consumption</li>
        <li> development of new services</li>
        <li> getting involved in the learning process</li>
      </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Perhaps you have another library technology topic that you would love to tell us about, but it doesn&rsquo;t fall neatly into one of the sub-themes. Don&rsquo;t be shy; tell us anyway! </p>
