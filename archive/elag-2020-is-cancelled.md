The organisers and programme committee of ELAG 2020 have decided to **cancel** this year’s conference. The ELAG 2020 conference was due to take place June 9-12, 2020 at the National Library of Latvia in Riga. Facing the uncertainties around the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) we concluded it’s best to **postpone ELAG 2020 to 2021.** 

We would like to thank everyone who submitted proposals for the conference! **We hope to see you all next year in Riga.** We will soon begin discussing a date for the next ELAG meeting and will inform you as soon as there are any news. Stay safe and healthy and see you next year! The organisers and programme committee of ELAG 2020/1
