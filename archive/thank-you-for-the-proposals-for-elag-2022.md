We have enough proposals to organise ELAG 2022 this summer 8-10 June in **Riga**, **Latvia**. If you still want to contribute to the conference, don't hesitate to send an email to the Chair of our Programme Committee : Peter van Boheemen at 
**peter.vanboheemen@wur.nl**.

Every ELAG conference is special, but this year it will be more special than ever. In these dark days for the world we want to show what the \`E' in ELAG stands for, organise an in-person conference, in Europe, open for everyone worldwide interested in library automation.
