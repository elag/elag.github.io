_Are you proud of the work that you did last year? Do you know things you want to share? Do you have a great idea? Are you able to teach your colleagues something?_ 

These were the questions we asked our ELAG attendees for several years to kindly invite them to join the oldest library tech conference in Europe (starting 1979). Having done this for over forty  years, never could we have imagined that 2020 **and** 2021 would be that much different from all other years.  

Alas, things turned out to be different than we hoped to be. A good-old fashioned ELAG conference with an official and unofficial program needs to wait for one more year when we are invited again to Riga. However, this won’t stop us from saying hello to you all and to listen to what you have been up to all these months. You all had enough time to change our library world. 

Therefore we will ask you once again: Are you proud of the work that you did last year? Do you know things you want to share? Do you have a great idea? Are you able to teach your colleagues something? Yes! Then join our online Mini-ELAG conference! We will use **Microsoft Teams**, each speaker will get a **5 minute** or a **10 minute** slot for  lightning talk presentation. 

**Please send in your proposal** here [https://forms.gle/d3YoFuHWBzYzdFVW7](https://forms.gle/d3YoFuHWBzYzdFVW7) 

Later this spring we will send out the contact details and a programme. We can’t wait to see you all again!
