The FAIR Signposting Profile\[1\] details a concrete recipe that repositories can follow to implement Signposting, a lightweight yet powerful approach to increase the Findability, Accessibility, and Interoperability of scholarly objects. Landing pages support humans that interact with scholarly objects on the web, providing descriptive metadata and links to content. These pages are not optimised for use by machine agents that navigate the scholarly web. Signposting provides this type of information in a uniform machine-friendly way. It builds on widely implemented web protocols specified in IETF RFCs, yielding interoperability that is not restricted to the scholarly landscape but encompasses the web at large.
