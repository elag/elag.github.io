The international GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) Labs Community \[1\] was established in September 2018 following a “Building Library Labs’’ workshop organised by the BL Labs team at the British Library \[2\]. This initial event led to a second workshop at the Royal Library of Denmark in Copenhagen in March 2019 \[3\] which in turn inspired a Book Sprint in Doha, Qatar to write the hands-on guide “Open a GLAM Lab” \[4\]. Such activities have been catalysts for other Labs activities in a range of libraries, including the establishment of the KBR Digital Research Lab \[5\], a long-term collaboration between KBR – Royal Library of Belgium and the Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities, Ghent University, Belgium to facilitate text and data mining research on KBR’s digitised and born-digital collections; the emerging DATA-KBR-BE open data platform, facilitating data-level access to KBR Collections and inspired by the North American ‘Collections as Data’ initiative \[6\], as well as the development of a series of GLAM Jupyter Notebooks \[7\] set-up by the BVMC Labs as part of the Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library, Alicante, Spain and inspired by the GLAM Workbench \[8\]. In this lightning talk we would like to give you a brief taste of some of our Labs’ experiments from the last few months, and hopefully inspire you to try some similar experiments in your library!
