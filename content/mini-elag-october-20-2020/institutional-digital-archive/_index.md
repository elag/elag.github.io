Digitally archiving studentsâ€™ research in the area of higher education has always been a challenge. Often these repositories are not very visual or lack integrations and transparent restrictions regarding access for external stakeholders is often missing. Moreover, the impact a digital archive has on the climate and physical storage is not to be underestimated. In this lightning talk we want to give you a demo of version one of the in-house developed open source repository that integrates with Learning Management Systems and tackles the earlier mentioned concerns. We will expand on the rationale behind the platform and dive into the technical architecture and infrastructure.
