University management is mostly interested in the analysis/results for their own faculty and not aggregated to the entire university. But Scopus does not link to faculties, at best to institutes or university affiliation numbers. We can use curators, but they do not want to be woken up at 3AM to do 1000 papers. So can we do this ourselves automatically and instantly?
