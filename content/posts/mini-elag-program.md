### Program

#### Collections as Data and Juypter Notebooks: experimenting in Library Labs

_Sally Chambers, Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities, Ghent University, Belgium, Julie M. Birkholz, KBR, Royal Library of Belgium’s Digital Research Lab & Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities, Ghent University, Belgium and Gustavo Candela, Department of Software and Computing Systems, University of Alicante, Spain_ 

The international GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) Labs Community \[1\] was established in September 2018 following a “Building Library Labs’' workshop organised by the BL Labs team at the British Library \[2\]. This initial event led to a second workshop at the Royal Library of Denmark in Copenhagen in March 2019 \[3\] which in turn inspired a Book Sprint in Doha, Qatar to write the hands-on guide “Open a GLAM Lab” \[4\]. Such activities have been catalysts for other Labs activities in a range of libraries, including the establishment of the KBR Digital Research Lab \[5\], a long-term collaboration between KBR - Royal Library of Belgium and the Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities, Ghent University, Belgium to facilitate text and data mining research on KBR’s digitised and born-digital collections; the emerging DATA-KBR-BE open data platform, facilitating data-level access to KBR Collections and inspired by the North American ‘Collections as Data’ initiative \[6\], as well as the development of a series of GLAM Jupyter Notebooks \[7\] set-up by the BVMC Labs as part of the Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library, Alicante, Spain and inspired by the GLAM Workbench \[8\]. In this lightning talk we would like to give you a brief taste of some of our Labs’ experiments from the last few months, and hopefully inspire you to try some similar experiments in your library!

Duration: 5 minutes

#### Federated Identity Management for Libraries

_Jos Westerbeke, Erasmus University Rotterdam_ 

Access to licensed e-resources is almost always provided based on IP address authentication. However, big publishers tend to move away from IP based access and libraries are facing publishers who want to use Single Sign-On (SSO) configurations. Libraries, then, need to setup SSO in the right way to protect the privacy of its patrons. Several librarians and technical specialists launched the Federated Identity Management for Libraries initiative (FIM4L, http://fim4l.org) to address the lack of a common best practise. A recommendation document is written about how to establish federated SSO for libraries while protecting privacy. It describes the attributes which can be released by the library and recommends two main options: An anonymous and a pseudonymous authentication. These recommendations would be useful for librarians and publishers too, to use FIM and set up federated SSO.

#### STFC Open Science Portal prototype

_Vasily Bunakov, STFC UKRI_ 

STFC UKRI is a large research organization, and a funder of science. STFC Open Science Portal is a Web application that integrates STFC records of science from a few in-house catalogues and external quality information sources beyond the organization walls. The talk will give a brief outline of the progress made with the implementation of this new information service. Duration: 5 minutes

#### The virtual librarian

_Peter van Boheemen, Wageningen University & Research Library_ 

Since your library user will not visit your library web site and will not use your library catalogue but will find what they need by browsing the internet, why not use browser plug-in technology to build a virtual librarian, that will travel with the user across any web site and assist the user when it is relevant. 

Duration: 5 minutes

#### OCR-D: An open ecosystem for improving OCR on historical documents

_Clemens Neudecker, Berlin State Library_ 

OCR for historical documents remains a tricky challenge. The German OCR-D project and community have in recent years created a fully open source framework and ecosystem for historical document OCR (https://ocr-d.de). Now the solutions developed will have to demonstrate their effectiveness in real-world implementation scenarios. In this lightning talk we want to introduce the OCR-D stack and its features and discuss the open and participative development strategy of OCR-D in order to encourage others to experiment with OCR-D, engage with its community and contribute their own experiences and findings. 

Duration: 10 minutes

#### Institutional Digital Archive

_Dries Vanacker & Dhany dHondt, Artevelde University of Applied Sciences_ 

Digitally archiving students' research in the area of higher education has always been a challenge. Often these repositories are not very visual or lack integrations and transparent restrictions regarding access for external stakeholders is often missing. Moreover, the impact a digital archive has on the climate and physical storage is not to be underestimated. In this lightning talk we want to give you a demo of version one of the in-house developed open source repository that integrates with Learning Management Systems and tackles the earlier mentioned concerns. We will expand on the rationale behind the platform and dive into the technical architecture and infrastructure. Duration: 10 minutes

#### Semantic structure recognition in tables of contents of periodicals and multilingual indexing of abstracts

_Manfred Hauer , AGI - Information Management Consultants_ 

intelligentCAPTURE articles moves metadata and abstract of - old and current - printed articles in periodicals or yearbooks into library catalogs. Metadata are recognized via a semantic structure recognition after scanning and OCR. Text like abstracts can be added and indexed from and into in many languages. Examples from Ibero-American Institute in Berlin will be given. 

Duration: 10 minutes

#### First steps with FOLIO in Leipzig

_Leander Seige, Leipzig University Library_ 

On June 11, 2020, Leipzig University Library was the first institution in Germany to put services based on FOLIO into productive operation. This was preceded by about two years of intensive work with the system and participation in the international community. This talk briefly reports on the first experiences with the system in terms of technical, librarian and organizational aspects. 

Duration: 10 minutes

#### Fatcat - Perpetual Access to Millions of Open Research Publications

_Martin Czygan, Internet Archive_ 

In 2017, with funding support from the Andrew Mellon Foundation and the Kahle/Austin Foundation, the Internet Archive launched a project focused on preserving all publicly accessible research documents, with a particular focus on open access and at-risk materials. As part of this effort, we built an editable catalog [https://fatcat.wiki/](https://fatcat.wiki/), with an open API to allow anybody to contribute. The software is free and open source, as is the data and we invite others to reuse and link to the content we have archived. This lightning talk will demo the site and its collaborative features. More information about the project can be found on its homepage \[1\] and a recent blog post \[2\].

Duration: 5 minutes

#### Help, Scopus does not link my papers to my faculties!

_Yasin Gunes, VU Amsterdam_ 

University management is mostly interested in the analysis/results for their own faculty and not aggregated to the entire university. But Scopus does not link to faculties, at best to institutes or university affiliation numbers. We can use curators, but they do not want to be woken up at 3AM to do 1000 papers. So can we do this ourselves automatically and instantly? 

Duration: 5 minutes

#### The FAIR Signposting Profile

_Herbert Van de Sompel, DANS_ 

The FAIR Signposting Profile\[1\] details a concrete recipe that repositories can follow to implement Signposting, a lightweight yet powerful approach to increase the Findability, Accessibility, and Interoperability of scholarly objects. Landing pages support humans that interact with scholarly objects on the web, providing descriptive metadata and links to content. These pages are not optimised for use by machine agents that navigate the scholarly web. Signposting provides this type of information in a uniform machine-friendly way. It builds on widely implemented web protocols specified in IETF RFCs, yielding interoperability that is not restricted to the scholarly landscape but encompasses the web at large.
