The next ELAG conference will take place in **Riga**, **Latvia** from **07 to 10 June 2022**.

"What a year it has been!", this alas we need to write for a second year in a row during this global COVID-19 pandemic. But, our ELAG team is still very enthusiastic to organise our next event in the beautiful town of Riga, with conference rooms, workshops, dinners and a drink in the local pubs. Yes, we don't know what will happen next year, but we set a deadline to make a decision by March 1 , 2022. By this date we will decide if the next ELAG take place _**in person**_ or a _**virtually**_ (like we did in 2020 and 2021). Rest assured, whatever the plans or the situation is in 2022: there will be a next ELAG. And, we need your help with presentations, workshops and ideas for bootcamps.

**How you can contribute!**

You can contribute to the ELAG conference in several ways, by submitting:

*   A **presentation** proposal:Â  These are the core of the ELAG programme. Presentations allow you to present your work in 25 minutes in a plenary session. After which there are 5 minutes for questions.
*   A **workshop** proposal: Workshops are run throughout the main ELAG programme and are used for group discussions on a selected topic. The workshop leader acts as the moderator of these discussions. Workshops are split into 2 sessions on 2 days of 1.5 hours each. On the last day the participants of the workshop need to present a short 10-15 minute summary about the results of the workshop during the plenary session.
*   A **bootcamp** proposal: Bootcamp take place on the day before the conference. They typically provide hands-on training on software, tools relevant to the community. Bootcamps can be short (2-3 hours) or take a whole day (6 hours).

Some ideas and previous topics for workshops and bootcamps: DevOps & infrastructure bootcamp, Fail4Lib (history of fails in your software projects), deep learning in libraries, a deep dive into tools like _Ansible_, _Apache Nifi,_ and _Catmandu_; or other!
