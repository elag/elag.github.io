We are ready to organise a new ELAG in **Riga**, **Latvia** from **June 7 to June 10, 2022**. Our call for proposals will be sent at the beginning of December.

Last two years it was hard to organise conferences and also ELAG didn't make it into a ELAG 2020 and ELAG 2021 conference. With our **Mini-ELAG** conference we gave you all ELAG in your doorstep, but next year we will try to make a good old ELAG conference again **on premise**, with conference rooms, workshops, dinners and visiting the local pubs.

**ELAG** is still Europe’s premier conference on the application of information technology in libraries and documentation centers. For over **forty years**, the ELAG (European Library Automation Group) Conference has provided library and IT professionals with the opportunity to discuss new technologies, to review on-going developments, and to exchange best practices.

Make yourself heard and participate in our community, but at least add this date to your calendar next year! We hope to see you all soon back in Latvia.

If you want to join ELAG and be part of our programme committee: send and email to our program chair Peter van Boheemen at **peter.vanboheemen@wur.nl**.
