ELAG is Europe's premier conference on the application of information technology in libraries and documentation centres. For over thirty years, the ELAG (European Library Automation Group) Conference has provided library and IT professionals with the opportunity to discuss new technologies, to review on-going developments and to exchange best practices. 

ELAG participants include more than 670 members in 27 countries all over Europe. The meetings aim at in depth discussions of particular library automation topics and at the promotion of informal exchange of ideas and experience. Topics of past conferences have included digital libraries, library portals, institutional repositories, web services, digital preservation and open source software. The topics covered are technical and meant for participants with an appropriate technical background. 

For those who want to continue the ELAG community discussions, we have an ELAG Slack channel were currently 81 library enthusiasts are participating.  Join us at: [http://elag-community.herokuapp.com/](http://elag-community.herokuapp.com/).
