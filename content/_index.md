## What is ELAG?

ELAG is a **technical conference** on library automation. We provide insights about "behind the scenes" technical topics. We dare to show library metadata standards, protocols and source code. Topic can range from cataloging practices to applying machine learning. At our conferences we mix presentations, workshops, boot camps and lightning talks. Our audience and presenters include: library IT staff, metadata specialists, archivists, management, researchers, and vendors.

ELAG is a small conference with **around 100 - 200 participants**. The presentation styles are usually quite **informal** and welcome participation from the audience. Due to the small size each conference is ideal for networking. The discussions don't stop when the presenter is ready and will continue after the official program in the pubs.

ELAG is a **single** track conference for all the _presentations_. During the conference **multiple simultaneous** _workshops_ and _boot camps_ will be organized.

## What do we need?

As an organizer of ELAG 2025 you will:

- Provide a conference venue for 4-5 days.
- A conference room that can fit in the order of 200 people.
- 4-8 smaller break out rooms for workshops and bootcamps.
- Optional organize a welcome reception.
- Organize a conference dinner.
- Create a conference website and registration and payment solution.
- Find sponsorship for the conference.
- Provide a local organizing committee.

The [ELAG programme committee](/about/) will provide:

- The call for presentations, workshops and boot camps.
- Selection of contributions to the conference.
- Program chairs and moderators.
- Assistance of organizers with lessons learned from previous conferences.
